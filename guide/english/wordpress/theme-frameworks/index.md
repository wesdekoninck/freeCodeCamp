# WordPress Development Environments

There are several modern choices for developing WordPress locally. If your development machine is set up for PHP and MySQL, you can use your existing setup, however, there are more modern setups that will allow you to change configurations and build pipelines more easily.

## Docker: WordPress _(Recommended)_

If you are familiar with Docker and containerization of development environments, there is an official WordPress Docker image available in the Docker Hub (link below). Need more information about Docker? Visit the official website at [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).

## Local by Flywheel

If you would prefer to have a GUI to manage your virtual machine setups for WordPress development, Flywheel has developed an application that can do just that. Local by Flywheel is available for both Mac and Windows.

## MAMP

If you are developing locally on a Mac computer, you can set up a local PHP/MYSQL stack to develop with by using the MAMP application (stands for **M**acintosh, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP).
